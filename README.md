# Scrolling News Feed


This is the news feed I used in the lower-left of https://twitch.tv/siouxfallsweather


It is HTML/CSS/JS in one HTML file that is loaded into OBS as an HTML element. It can be hosted on its own. 

Note, you will need the 'Star 4 Radar' font installed to have the same apperance as the fonts from the WeatherStar 4000.
